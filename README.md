# Pocket-Diary

***A website to efficiently manage your contacts online and socialize with others***

Lets you create your profile and maintain all your contacts online. You may also explore other PocketDiary users to fetch their contact information and ultimately socialize more. Your contacts will not be accessible to others.

* Used PHP for the back-end
* Used MySQL database
* Used AJAX for fetching search results and invalid data while filling forms in real time
* Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript & some JS frameworks for the front-end and validation

Website: [pocketdiary.epizy.com](pocketdiary.epizy.com)

To build it locally:

* Set up the Apache-MySQL-PHP stack (preferably LAMP/WAMP/XAMPP based on your OS)
* You need to have a web browser installed (preferably Google Chrome, I've yet to add full support for others)
* Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Anishka0107/Pocket-Diary`
* Setup the database using `website/DB/pocket_diary.sql`
* Open `index.php` after starting the local server
